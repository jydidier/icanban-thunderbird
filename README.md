# icanban-thunderbird
An extension to view ical's VTODO entries in a Kanban board.

There are two ways to display the Kanban board once the extension has been 
installed. The first one is through the *Kanban* button displayed in the top
window bar when consulting emails. The second one is through the *Tools* menu
in which you can find an item named *Display Kanban board*.
